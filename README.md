# Reporting templates

## Style

Report templates should require as few changes as possible when copying and pasting. Whitespace has been added at the start of each file to avoid having to add later.

### Naming structure

* To keep report templates easy to navigate, filenames are structured as:
`template_<modality>_<examination>.txt`

## References

   templates](https://www.rsna.org/practice-tools/data-tools-and-standards/radreport-reporting-templates)
1. [Radiology Assistant NL ankle
   examination](https://radiologyassistant.nl/musculoskeletal/ankle/mri-examination)

## TODO

1. Scripts to create templates compatible with various voice recognition
   systems
1. Customisable signature
1. Adjustable configuration with sensible defaults
