# Reporting templates

## Style

Report templates should require as few changes as possible when copying and pasting. Whitespace has been added at the start of each file to avoid having to add later.

### Naming structure

* To keep report templates easy to navigate, filenames are structured as:
`template_<modality>_<examination>.txt`
