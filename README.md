# Reporting templates

## Style

Report templates should require as few changes as possible when copying and pasting. Whitespace has been added at the start of each file to avoid having to add later.

### Naming structure

* To keep report templates easy to navigate, filenames are structured as:
`template_<modality>_<examination>.txt`

## TODO

1. Convert initial example template to a structured format stored in JSON
    1. Useful links
1. Makefile to create templates compatible with various voice recognition
   systems
